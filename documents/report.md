We both started with getting the images from poster 1 and poster 2. 
We decided to use the images from poster 2 to create our webpage.

We devided each section, so we wouldn't work on the same elements.

Hvorfor valgte vi Ã¥ animere dette?
The three people with phones are animated using keyframes so they sort of wave, moving to the left and right indefinitely.

The green bacteria/faces are animated using keyframes so that they "bounce" from earth and back down again. We chose to animate half of them for 3 seconds, and the other half of 6 seconds to create some diversion between them.
