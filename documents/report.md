We started with getting the svg/images from poster 1 and poster 2. After implementing all the svg/images we wanted, we decided to focus on poster 2 to create our webpage.

We divided each section, so we wouldn't work on the same elements.

The three people with phones are animated using keyframes so they sort of wave, moving to the left and right indefinitely.

The green bacteria/faces are animated using keyframes so that they "bounce" from earth and back down again. We chose to animate half of them for 3 seconds, and the other half of 6 seconds to create some diversion between them.
4 of the green bacteria/faces changes color from green to gray, so that it seems more convincing that it is pollution from earth. To do so, we had to combine two animations in one, called combinedAnimation, so that they bounce as well as change the color gradually and indefinitely.

We created text-path and car-path in illustrator. We used animateMotion to animate the car along the car path. The text-path was created so we could curve the text. 

The moon are animated using keyframes, so it moves up and down, simulating how the moon would look like in real life.

We used keyframes to animate the two stars next to the moon so they rotate. We thought rotating the stars would make them "sparkle".
